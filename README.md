# Neo-Metal-Sonic-Papercraft
Neo's papercraft model by yours truly

quick disclaimer!!
this is my first papercraft project ever so expect some really difficult parts or some unoptimised stuff

neo metal sonic (the character) is owned by sega
the model was made by me in blockbench and the template itself was made with pepakura and enhanced by me

the .bbmodel file is the blockbench file, feel free to use it so see how the model is constructed but please to not repost without my permission

the.rar file with the .pdf file is where the template itself is at

good luck and happy crafting! 


cheers,
aslegger
